# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following image files for the Expo app:

## Required Images:

1. **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024 px)
   - Should feature the biblical theme colors (parchment, gold)
   - Could be a stylized Bible or scroll icon

2. **splash.png** - Splash screen (1242x2436 px for iOS, 1080x1920 px for Android)
   - Background color: #F5F0E8 (parchment cream)
   - Could feature the MemoryVerse logo and Bible companion character

3. **adaptive-icon.png** - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024 px)
   - Foreground image for Android's adaptive icons
   - Background color: #F5F0E8

4. **favicon.png** - Web favicon (48x48 px)
   - Small icon for web version

## Temporary Workaround:

Until you add real images, Expo will use default placeholders. The app will still run and function perfectly.

To add your own images:
1. Create or design images with the specifications above
2. Save them in this folder with the exact names listed
3. Restart the Expo development server

## Design Guidelines:

- Use biblical colors: sandy beige, parchment cream, gold, terracotta
- Keep designs minimal and reverent
- Consider featuring a closed book or scroll
- Use soft shadows and warm tones
