## 🎓 Learning & Notes

### Authentication Implementation
- Used React Context API for global state
- Supabase auth.onAuthStateChange for real-time updates
- Session automatically persists via Supabase client

### Data Flow Architecture
```
AuthContext (user + profile)
    ↓
  Screens (consume via useAuth() hook)
    ↓
  Services (database operations)
    ↓
  Supabase (backend)
```

### Key Services Ready
- `authService` - Sign in/up/out
- `profileService` - User data CRUD
- `achievementService` - Badge system
- `verseService` - Verse CRUD + practice tracking
- `contextGenerator` - AI context generation
